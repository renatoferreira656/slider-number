# Slider Number

This is an atom plugin for increase and decrease numbers.

The original idea is based in changing numbers from css files.
I've created this plugin to work with [LiveReload](https://atom.io/packages/livereload).
Helping me to change numbers in some pre-determined scale and see the change of CSS fast.

The plugin is published in [Atom Repository](https://atom.io/packages/slider-number)
